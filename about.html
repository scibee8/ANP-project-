    <p>This is my final project for ANP 412 at Michigan State University.
        I would like to give credit to the Natural History Museum Vienna
        for the 3D models I used which I obtained from thier Sketchfab. 
        I would also like to give credit to this article: 
        https://medium.com/swlh/build-your-location-based-augmented-reality-web-app-a841956eed2c
        and it author for some of the code used to make this web app. 
        <p>
        
        </p>The models displayed are the Venus of Willendorf, 
        a bone point fragment found at the same site as the Venus of Willendorf, 
        and a Neolithic logboat model found at the Mondsee World Heritage Site.</p>
